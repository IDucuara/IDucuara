 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Camilo Ducuara (@IDucuara)
IÂ´m a Full-Stack Web Developer, Game Designer, Graphic Designer, and Illustrator, with strong and updated videogames skills,
I have dedicated the last three years to learning everything in regards to video games development, design, and Narrative Design. 
knowledge of Unreal and Unity and I have practiced with my own game design and 3 different projects that will be out in march of 2023. 
Graphic designer and illustrator for Editorials, Government agencies, and private companies. Experience leading teams and operations processes. 

To complement my skills started my journey as a Developer and now IÂ´m graduated from SoyHenry Bootcamp with over 800 hours of practice, 
during this process I rediscover my passion for design through the code, I feel the Front-end like my zone, and I can move freely with it 
but I can work with the Back-end as well. through this process, my curiosity to learn and absorb more knowledge, and new technologies increased 
and my goal is to improve day by day, keeping in mind the importance of teamwork, common goals, and effective communication to reach amazing results.

ðŸŒ± This is just the beginning, now IÂ´m polishing my abilities through new courses to complement my knowledge and learning new languages (C++ and C#)
to connect in a near future my new passion with my inner dream, the love for code with the Game Design.
